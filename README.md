# Build a To-do app following TDD   

## User stories:
As a disorganised person I want to:

- enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
- view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
- mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
- the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb

**Potential stretch goals**  
As a disorganised person I want to:

- edit my to-dos so that I can amend them if the task changes
- click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete so that it's easier for me to check to-dos off
- a visual indication of which to-do I'm about to interact with so that it's clear what I'm editing

## Our development process:  

First we write tests to implement basics logical pure functions to process (TDD) user's actions:  
- Add a new todo
- Delete an existing todo
- Mark a Todo as done/undone

Then we coded:
- the function launched when the event 'create new todo' occurs,
- and afterwards the DOM manipulation part to display the updated todos list on the page.

At the end, we separate in two teams:
- one worked on the CSS
- the other implement a sort function

Now, we're trying to improve code and enhance functionalities...
